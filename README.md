# ABACC RAG

ABACC RAG stands for Attribute-Based Access Controlled Context for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

Most of the retrieval examples usually consider the user to feed the LLM with a series of documents that they deemed relevant to their prompting activity.
While this approach has a direct value for a single user, it isn't at an organizational level. However, the most complex challenge with organization-wide knowledge is **who can access what, from where, and when**. 

The ABACC RAG illustrates the ability to leverage enriched metadata, with, in this example, the usage of extended attributes at a Unix/Linux file system level, or a third-party enterprise solution like NetApp BlueXP Data Sense at scale.
